Building and Uploading Your Sphinx Docs to pypi
***********************************************

Building sphinx-build directly
==============================

First, create a ``doc`` directory at the root level and ``cd`` into that
directory. 

Sphinx's quick start program will give you an option to make Makefile and 
a Windows .bat file.  Personally, I find it easier just to call sphinx-build
directly.  

On linux::

	$ /usr/bin/sphinx-build -b -E html source build\html

On windows::

	$ C:\Python26\scripts\sphinx-build.exe -b -E html source build\html

.. note::

   The ``-E`` flag forces sphinx to always reread the files. 
   


Building pdf document
=====================

To date, I've only built the pdf on a windows system.  

On Windows, first you need to grab and install MiTek from http://miktex.org/
which is used to convert tex to pdf. 

On windows you would run a script like this from the ``doc`` directory::
	
	C:\Python26\scripts\sphinx-build.exe -b latex source build\pdf
	texify --clean --pdf build\pdf\an_example_pypi_project.tex

.. only:: html 
   
   Here is the pdf :download:`An Example Pypi Project<docs/an_example_pypi_project.pdf>`.

	 
.. note:: 

   When using the pdf option, you often use the ``.. only:: html`` directive.
   
   For example, the download link for the pdf does not make sense to be in the
   pdf itself, so you use:
   
   ``:download:`An Example Pypi Project<docs/an_example_pypi_project.pdf>```
